# BugFire
PC-8001 BUG FIRE! on Windows.

It is a game, similar "BUG FIRE!" for PC-8001, almost same.  
You can play the game, with "BugFire.exe" only.

## Limitation
- No color flicker of walls or a man. (No plan of implementation, but i feel it cool...).  
(It is PC-8001's CRTC and programming limitation)

## Bugs (not a character in game, but programming bugs)
- No game over with time limit or score < 0.  
- A new BUG (after all bugs killed, new one BUG appears) moves not smooth.
- BUGs can not eat the man, when crossing a BUG and a man.
(But it's funny)
- Disappear exit path, after you were killed by a new BUG (after killing all BUGs, a bug will appear).  
  You need to kill the new BUG.

and so on...

But you can enjoy it, maybe.

## Difference from Original.
### Key binding.  
* Arrow or "WASD" keys also to control the man, too.  
* ESC key to pause the game.
